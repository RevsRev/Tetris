# Tetris
Basic Tetris game written in python, using matplotlib for user interface

Matplotlib's event handler isn't great (or, more likely, I am too experienced at coding to make it work smoothly), so the game feels a bit clunky. Also, you can't see what pices come next, and there is no background music or nice scoreboard. Apart from this, it is true to the original game.

I hope to redo this game (perhaps using pyglet rather than matplotlib) at some point.

To play, import Tetris and type Tetris.play_tetris()
